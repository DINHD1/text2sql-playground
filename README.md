# Welcome to your Lovable project

## Project info
This Python framework builds an enterprise-grade Text-to-SQL system for fixed SQL schemas, like grocery sales databases, enabling natural language queries via Google's Gemini and Gemma models. It auto-generates SQLite queries with schema-aware joins and aggregations, uses few-shot prompting for accuracy, and benchmarks performance (exact match, similarity). Ideal for secure, compliant retail analytics without exposing raw SQL.
